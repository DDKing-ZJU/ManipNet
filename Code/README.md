Code
============


Unity
------------
<p>
  1. Open asset - "Unity/ManipNet/Assets" with Unity;
</p>
<p>
  2. Open scene - "Assets/Project/Demo" and run the Demo;
</p>
<p>
  3. <b>Known Issue1 - </b> For Mac user, Eigen.budle file ("Assets/Plugins/Eigen/Eigen.bundle") might be forced to deleted at the first run, but you can simply place it back from Trash, it should work at the second run.
</p>

Tensorflow
------------
<p>
  1. Tensorflow folder includes the training code with a small training data (Cylinder.zip);
</p>
<p>
  2. Trained model will be saved in "Tensorflow/Data/Model/ManipNetBIN" folder (which can replace "Unity/ManipNetBIN" for testing inside Unity);
</p>
